-- Type class for a polymorphic fold function on abstract syntax trees.
--
--  * The first argument is the aggregator for combining
--    results of recursive folds.
--  * The second argument is a function that will be applied to
--    (i.e., and will replace) Variable nodes.
--  * The third argument is a constant that will replace all
--    non-Variable leaf nodes (i.e., Value nodes).
--  * The fourth argument is the abstract syntax tree that
--    will be folded.
